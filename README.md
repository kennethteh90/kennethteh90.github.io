# Welcome to Kenneth Teh's Github Map!
#### This is a map of my Github. You can skip to the repos [here (GitHub Page)](https://github.com/kennethteh90) or read on for an overview of my projects.

### Projects
##### My side projects
* [Guest Tracking System (Rails)](http://bit.ly/hosttrackgit) - this simple app solved an annoying problem for us in church. Basically, we were using a group chat for our host team to keep track of new guests in church, but the issue was that we didn't have a common list that could be added to or edited. Instead, we were manually copying and pasting previous lists, then adding to/editing them. Blog post [here](http://bit.ly/hosttrackmedium).
* [Birthday/Event Reminder App (Google Apps Script)](https://medium.com/@kennethteh90/a-birthday-reminders-app-edd50a72546d) - wrote a few lines of code to make my initial 'app' accessible to non-coders. This app sends reminder messages to a chat group through the Telegram bot API.

##### Rails
* [Twitter Clone](http://bit.ly/kentwitterclone) - Class project. This was quite interesting because I managed to try out quite a few methods of implementing the Twitter hashtag functionality. __Version 1:__ has_many association, __Version 2:__ Nested forms, __Version 3:__ inline hashtagging and mark.js for link highlighting.
* [Twitter Clone Redo](http://bit.ly/reclone) - Did this when the project was over to solidify my understanding of self-referential associations. [Deployed here](http://bit.ly/twitterheroku). Also [wrote a guide](http://bit.ly/twittercloneguide) for my fellow students (and anyone else who's struggling with this!)
* [Online Store](http://bit.ly/kenshoppinggit) - Built an online store using Rails, sessions and Redis (pair project).
* [Online Store Redo](http://bit.ly/shoppingredo) - Redid this after the project so I could have clean code and so I could write a guide on [how to build an e-commerce store with Rails](http://bit.ly/kenonlinestore).

##### React

* [Note Taking App Version 1.0](https://github.com/kennethteh90/react-note-app) - I had to learn React.js on my own, because as part of Alpha Camp, we had to work on an external project with Zalora, and their preferred front-end library was React.js. Did this as part of our Alumni Meetup (where we were coincidentally discussing React).
* [Note Taking App Version 1.1](http://bit.ly/noteappredo) - I wasn't satisfied with the first app, because it seemed like I wasn't following the spirit of React, or even coding in general (the code was a mess), so I redid it here. [Deployed here](https://kennethteh90.github.io/react-note-app-redo/). You can read my [blog post on Medium](https://medium.com/@kennethteh90/alpha-camp-week-9-of-12-learning-journal-be024a02a989).

##### Phoenix
* [URL Shortener](http://bit.ly/kenshorturl) - As part of our Alumni Meetup series, we were self-learning Elixir and Phoenix to share. This was the project I built to learn about routing and redirecting in Phoenix. Also wrote about it on [Medium](https://medium.com/@kennethteh90/alpha-camp-and-beyond-ee6c8f1a0f49). You can [try out the app on Heroku](https://gentle-depths-18862.herokuapp.com/links)

##### Ruby
* [Tic Tac Toe](http://bit.ly/kentictactoe) - Wrote this after my first few days working with Ruby (pair project). The code was not as polished as I'd hoped, but it was exciting to see the game work. The game has two levels: human v. human and human v. computer. This is a random-move computer, though, so I might revisit this to implement a smart AI that cannot be beaten!
